<center><h1>EXCRETION</h1></center>
<p>We have already discussed how organisms get rid of gaseous wastes generated during photosynthesis or respiration. Other metabolic activities generate nitrogenous materials which need to be removed. The biological process involved in the removal of these harmful metabolic wastes from the body is called excretion. Different organisms use varied strategies to do this. Many unicellular organisms remove these wastes by simple diffusion from the body surface into the surrounding water. As we have seen in other processes, complex multi-cellular organisms use specialised organs to perform the same function.</p>

<center><h1>EXCRETION IN HUMAN BEINGS</h1></center>
<p>The excretory system of human beings includes a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary bladder and a urethra. Kidneys are located in the abdomen, one on either side of the backbone. Urine produced in the kidneys passes through the ureters into the urinary bladder where it is stored until it is released through the urethra.</p>
<p>How is urine produced? The purpose of making urine is to filter out waste products from the blood. Just as CO2 is removed from the blood in the lungs, nitrogenous waste such as urea or uric acid are removed from blood in the kidneys. It is then no surprise that the basic filtration unit in the kidneys, like in the lungs, is a cluster of very thin-walled blood capillaries. Each capillary cluster in the kidney is associated with the cup-shaped end of a tube that collects the filtered urine . Each kidney has large numbers of these filtration units called nephrons packed close together. Some substances in the initial filtrate, such as glucose, amino acids, salts and a major amount of water, are selectively re-absorbed as the urine flows along the tube. The amount of water re-absorbed depends on how much excess water there is in the body, and on how much of dissolved waste there is to be excreted. The urine forming in each kidney eventually enters a long tube, the ureter, which connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder. Urine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure of the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out through the urethra. The bladder is muscular, so it is under nervous control, as we have discussed elsewhere. As a result, we can usually control the urge to urinate.</p>

<center><h1>MORE TO KNOW !</h1></center>
<p>Kidneys are vital organs for survival. Several factors like infections, injury or restricted blood flow to kidneys reduce the activity of kidneys. This leads to accumulation of poisonous wastes in the body, which can even lead to death. In case of kidney failure, an artificial kidney can be used. An artificial kidney is a device to remove nitrogenous waste products from the blood through dialysis.Artificial kidneys contain a number of tubes with a semi-permeable lining, suspended in a tank filled with dialysing fluid. This fluid has the same osmotic pressure as blood, except that it is devoid of nitrogenous wastes. The patient’s blood is passed through these tubes. During this passage, the waste product from the blood pass into dialysing fluid diffusion. The purified blood is pumped back into the patient. This is similar to the function of the kidney, but it is different since there is no re-absorption involved. Normally, in a healthy adult, the initial filtrate in the kidneys is about 180 L daily. However, the volume actually excreted is only a litre or two a day, because the remaining filtrate is re-absorbed in the kidney tubules.</p>
<center><h1>EXCRETORY SYSTEM</h1></center>
<p>Due to cellular respiration, a lot of gases and other waste products are produced inside an organism’s body. They must be removed properly and periodically. Without their removal, they can prove harmful to the human body as they can be toxic to the body.</p>
<p>Excretion is this process of removal of wastes that are produced within a body. There are various organs that help in excretion of such wastes from our body. They are kidney, lungs, skin, eyes, etc.</p>
<p>We know that blood transports food, air, and water to different parts of our body. It also carries waste products. The human body consists of a specialized system which purifies the blood. This system is known as excretory system. An excretory system is basically composed of the following components:</p>
<p><b>A pair of kidneys</b><br><b>A pair of ureters</b><br><b>Urinary bladder</b><br><b>Urethra</b></p>
<p>Let us discuss the human excretory system more in-depth.</p>
<h1>Kidney</h1>
<p>Kidneys are bean-shaped organs in the human body. They play a vital role in the excretory system of our body. They basically act as filters in our body. Blood contains both useful and harmful substances.</p>
<p>Kidneys play an important role in separating useful substances by re-absorption and toxic substances by forming urine. Capillaries, which are a type of blood vessels in the kidneys, help in filtering the blood and wastes materials. It then converts these into the urine.</p>
<h1>Urinary Bladder, Ureter, and Urethra</h1>
<p>Urine, thus formed, passes on to the urinary bladder via ureter. Through the urinary opening at urethra, we excrete urine. Urine consists of 95% water, 2.5% urea and 2.5% other wastes. This system expells from time to time.</p>
<center><h1>TYPE OF WASTES AND MODE OF EXCRETION</h1></center>
<p>Protein mainly consists of nitrogen. Thus, the metabolism of protein creates nitrogenous wastes in the body. The nitrogenous waste is the primary form of waste in animals. This nitrogenous waste can take different forms in different types of animals. The types of this waste include ammonia, urea, and uric acid. Based on the type of nitrogenous waste, we can divide animals into the following major categories:</p>
<p><b>Ammonotelic:</b> These animals have ammonia as the main nitrogenous waste. These are typically aquatic animals, e.g. fish, frogs, etc. These animals require a lot of water to remove the wastes.</p>
<p><b>Ureotelism:</b> These animals produce urea as the main nitrogenous waste. Common examples include mammals that need less water.</p>
<p><b>Urecotellism:</b> In these animals, uric acid is the main nitrogenous waste. Examples include reptiles that need negligent amounts of water.</p>
